# 5G-Wireless-Network
My work during the Internship was mainly focused on technology of millimeter
wave which will help in next generation-5G wireless. Due to high frequency
signals in millimetre wave frequency band it could allocate more bandwidth to
deliver faster, high-quality video and multimedia content. Use of millimeter
wave will improve the efficiency because the directional transmission between
the base station and a mobile device reduces signal interference, and that might
account for the reduction in energy. Energy efficiency is very important with
term of millimetre wave because of growth in the number of users and
devicesâ€”and efficiency should be considered with any new standard.
I tried to model channel for millimeter wave and performed a hybrid precoding
to enable gigabit-per-second data rate and also tried some other precoding
models and tried to compare data rates between different precoding schemes.
After that I worked on V2V communication for MM wave. V2V
communication is very important now days because frequent traffic accidents
causing enormous number of deaths and injuries have become a serious health
and social issue and there is also saying connected cars will be the ultimate of
Internet of Things. In V2V communication I modelled V2V channel for mm
wave and performed a hybrid precoding on it and compared it with static
channel.
